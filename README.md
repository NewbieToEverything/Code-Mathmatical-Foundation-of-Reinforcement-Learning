This is the repository hosting the R scripts of the book "[Mathematical Foundations of Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/MathFoundationRL/Book-Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning)" written by Yujun at Jiangxi Normal University.

All R scripts are stored in the code folder.

Algorithms are in the "functions.R", including:
 - Chapter 2: solving state values from Bellman equation using closed-form solution and iterative solution, and calculating action values from state values;
 - Chapter 4: value iteration, policy iteration, and truncated policy iteration;
 - Chapter 5: Monte Carlo basic, Monte Carlo exploring starts;
 - Chapter 7: Sarsa, expected Sarsa, n-step Sarsa, and Q learning (on-policy).

Several examples are realized and written in the R scripts with identical names to the chapter hosting those examples.
